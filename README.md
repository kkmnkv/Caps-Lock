# Caps-Lock
The program that corrects the string recorded using the Caps Lock key, or leaves unchanged if the string is written correctly. Â We assume that a word is typed with the wrongly pressed Caps Lock key if: 1) or it consists entirely of capital letters; 2) or all uppercase letters are capitalized except the first.
